# NHL Rookie Year Predictions
This is a personal project of mine to predict the statline of NHL rookies the year they entered the league.

Right now there is only an iPYNB file in the repository because it is easier to visualize the data during the preprocessing phase. Later iterations of this project include CLI to look up a rookie and their predicted statlines, as well as entering a rookie with certain details and predicting their statlines.
