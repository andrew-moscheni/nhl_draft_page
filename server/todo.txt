DATA COLLECTION STEPS (HockeyDB)
1. collect draft year and seasonal stats

    -> use psycopg2 to import directly into the PostgreSQL database after scraping

2. collect team stats by year

    -> name, year, goals_for, goals_against

3. collect game logs of each player's last 20 games to be used in predictions

    -> ACP with external predictors
